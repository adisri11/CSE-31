TPS 1:
1. Cache is the small memory located next to the CPU the stores frequently access data. IT is needed because it is much faster
    than the original form of storing memory, which is the RAM.
4. We need 4 bits. It is not practical to have a block size of 1 byte because it increases the number of cache misses and 
    reduces spatial locality benefits.
5. We need 6 bits. It is log base 2 of the number of blocks.
6. Yes, you multiply the number of blocks and the block size.
7. The leftover bits become the tag. This is important as it verifies if the data came from the right address.
8. a)
