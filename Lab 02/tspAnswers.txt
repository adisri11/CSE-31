TPS 1:
1. Guadalupe, Victor

TPS 2:
1. To compile to use lldb, you would use gcc -g -o program_name source_file.c
2. To load it into lldb you type lldb ./punish into the terminal.
3. To run you simply type run in the terminal.
4. A breakpoint is a location in the code where you pause the execution of the code. You can set a breakpoint by typing in b and
    then the line number or the function name.
5. You can run the code line by line by typing n in the terminal.
6. You can see the value of variables by typing in print and then the variable name.
7. You can type in c to let the program finish.
8. You type q or exit to exit lldb.

TPS 3:
1. 4 variables, 2 are pointers (px and py)
2. The variables would have random values. This is because while the variable was created there is no value assigned to it. 
8. The result makes sense because arr[0] is the beginning of arr, which would mean that they have the same address.
