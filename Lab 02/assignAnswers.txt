Assignment 1:
1. Line 25 caused the segmentation fault.
2. You need to reference the input variable. (put & in front of input)
3. The value of sum inside the read_values function is not being retunred.
4. Inside read_values, you make sum a pointer. Then in main when inputting sum into read_values you need to reference it.

Assignment 2:
1. Yes
2. No, the bug is that the array s1 is not empty upon adding the new string "HI!". It overwrites the HELLO!, 
    but does not overwrite the addition hello! that was appended earlier. You fix this by making everything 
    after the appended two new strings null
3. No, I think this happens because the string only takes in 10 characters.
