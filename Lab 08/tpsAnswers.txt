TPS 1:
5. No we do not need the definition of n anymore. We also do not need to load value of n into $t3 anymore as we load the inputed value instead.

TPS 2:
1. The output will be:
Returning 1
Returning 3
Returning 3
Returning 1
Returning 3
Returning 3
Returning 1

2. The main function right now creates space in a stack frame to sotre one value, then moves the value of $sp to $s1, 
    then calls recursion. Upon returning it jumps to the end of the program.
5. We expect it to be stored in $v0, so we can just move it to $t0, and then to $a0 so it can be printed. 
7. Three integers can be stored.
10. Because we call recursion twice, we need both values of $a0.
12. the return value from the first call would be lost.
15. We need to restore the return address $ra.
