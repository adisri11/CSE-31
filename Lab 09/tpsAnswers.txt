TPS 1:
4. Generally a machine instruction for MIPS has 32 bits.
5. There are 3 types, register type, immediate type, and jump type. Add and sub are register types. Addi and lw are immediate types. j and jal are of jump type.
6. a) addi is an immediate type. There are 4 fields, opcode, rs, rt, and immediate value. 
   b) opcode is 0x08, the rs register is $zero with a hex of 0x00, the rt is in the $s0 register with a hex of 0x10. The value of the immediate 25 in hex is 0x19.
   c) In binary the instruction is 001000 00000 10000 0000000000011001. In hex the instruction is 0x20100019.
7. a) The machine code in hex is 0x0230402a. This in binary is 0000 0010 0011 0000 0100 0000 0010 1010. 
   b) The instruction is a register type because the opcode is 0, which refers to a register type. 
   c)
