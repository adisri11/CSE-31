TPS 1:
1. The starting value for Text segment is 0x00400000 and the data segment is 0x10010000.
2. There is a difference in the way the registers are named and in some of the instructions, for example in source it is la but in basic it is luv.
3. 28 bytes
4. Each has 8 columns.
5. Every new column the address increases by 4 bytes.
6. You type m:	.word 20 under .data.
7. 0x10010004 is the address where m is stored.
9. The addresses are 0x10010008, 0x1001000c, and 0x10010010.
10. It stores in reverse, the same as what I found in Lab 04.

TPS2:
1. it allows for the MIPs architecture to be more compact and have efficient instructions.
