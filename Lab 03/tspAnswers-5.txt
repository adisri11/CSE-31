TPS 1:
1. Stack, heap, and static. Stack has local variables, heap has dynamically allocated vairables, and static has global
    variables.
2. a. 3
   b. 2, ptr points to int while handle points to a pointer.
   c. stack
   d. heap
3. num: 0x7ff7b7339458 
   ptr: 0x7ff7b7339450 
   handle: 0x7ff7b7339448

TPS 2:
1. A struct is created for Node, which initailizes a float, and int, and a pointer to another Node. In the main function,
    the first line allocates space for a node structure assigned to head. The integer value for the head node is set to 5
    and the float value is set to 3.14.
2. head value: 0x7fc2c3705c80 
   head address: 0x7ff7b41be440 
   iValue address: 0x7fc2c3705c80 
   fValue address: 0x7fc2c3705c84 
   next address: 0x7fc2c3705c88
3. A struct is stored in memory somewhat similar to an array. Any elements in the struct are stored one after another. The
    only difference is the address of the struct is not the same as the first variable initialtized in the struct. The 
    value of the struct is the same as the address of the first initialized variable.
